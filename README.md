# hello-world
My first repository I guess?

I guess I'm following the Hello World project. 

One day I'll look back at this repository and see how much I've learned.
I want to learn JavaScript and Python and hopefully I can do that by the time I finish high school.
Forgot to say this in the beginning but the name's Shahrom. Pretty unique huh?
